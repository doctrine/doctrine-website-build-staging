        <hr />

        <div>
            A few days ago, the Doctrine team released new versions of many packages, dropping
support for PHP 5.6 and 7.0, as well as HHVM. The affected packages are:

- doctrine/common 2.8.0
- doctrine/dbal 2.6.0
- doctrine/collections 1.5.0
- doctrine/inflector 1.2.0
- doctrine/cache 1.7.0
- doctrine/instantiator 1.1.0
- doctrine/annotations 1.5.0

Since many people are encountering issues with these updates, here are a few
suggestions to ensure your code continues working as usual.

Composer version constraints
----------------------------

Chances are your version constraints in ``composer.json`` look something like this:

.. code-block:: json

    {
        "require": {
            "doctrine/orm": "^2.5"
        }
    }

The ``^2.5`` constraint resolves to: ``>= 2.5.0 && <= 2.999999.999999``. This is
intended: our projects all follow `Semantic Versioning <http://semver.org/>`__,
so you can safely install a new minor version without having to fear BC breaks.

When determining what version to install, composer employs a SAT solver to make
sure all dependencies are fulfilled. In our example above, the SAT solver finds
a version newer than 2.5 that satisfies all requirements.

Making sure you get a compatible version
----------------------------------------

When you run ``composer update`` the next time, you'll automatically receive
updates for the packages mentioned above, provided that you are running on PHP
7.1. If you are running an older PHP version, composer will not install a version
that requires PHP 7.1, since its requirements are not fulfilled.

A common problem is people running a newer PHP version on their developer machines
than on their production servers. In this case, running ``composer update`` on
a developer machine (with PHP 7.1) might happily pull in an update that simply
won't work when deployed on a production machine running PHP 5.6.

To make sure this doesn't happen to you, there are two choices:

-  run ``composer update`` on a machine with the same PHP version that you use
   in production
-  use the `platform.config <https://getcomposer.org/doc/06-config.md#platform>`__
   config setting in ``composer.json`` to override your local PHP version.

Why dropping PHP support in a minor version is not a BC break
-------------------------------------------------------------

One question we frequently hear is, "isn't dropping support for a PHP version a
BC break"? In a nutshell, no. A BC break happens when there is an incompatible
change that your package manager can't handle. For example, changing a method
signature in a minor version is a no-go, since the composer version constraints
mentioned above assume any minor upgrade can safely be used.

However, when we drop support for an older version of PHP, composer will not
consider the new version if the PHP version requirement is no longer fulfilled.
Thus, you won't end up with a fatal error due to a wrong method signature, you
just won't get the new version.

        <div>
            .. note:: 

    This article is an April Fools joke.

It has been few months since we shed some light on the `future of Doctrine project <https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2/issues/6211>`__
and had an extensive insight into what `Guilherme <https://twitter.com/guilhermeblanco>`__ had been up to. Adding
tens of megabytes of IRC logs of internal discussion we felt we owe you an update on where Doctrine is and where
it's heading to:

Doctrine 3 Is No More!
----------------------

Rest assured, we are in no way ditching all the code Guilherme hacked so far or any of the ideas that sprung
for the next major release. We are still looking into leveraging all goodies that were given to us with PHP 7.
We want the next Doctrine version to be an extremely stable and reliable piece of software. We are also still trying to figure out how to maintain all projects under Doctrine's umbrella effectively. To recap,
Doctrine is not only the ORM you all know, we are also maintaining a number of ODM projects (`MongoDB <https://github.com/doctrine/mongodb-odm>`__
and `CouchDB <https://github.com/doctrine/couchdb-odm>`__ to name few) which all share basic concepts and code.
Some of them also face a major rewrite, like the much anticipated MongoDB ODM 2.0 with support for new MongoDB driver.

Joining Forces
--------------

Instead of having each team work independently and implement the same concepts multiple times across various libraries,
we decided it's for the best if we all work on one project and make it as good and robust as possible.
In the spirit of breaking boundaries, Doctrine 4 will be all about interoperability. **Doctrine 4 will support
both RDBMS and NoSQL databases at the same time!**

Following Latest Trends
-----------------------

A really big thing we want to (re)introduce is an Active Record pattern. We recently ran a poll on the #doctrine IRC
channel and it turned out that 68% of developers die a little bit each time they inject a service, which
barely saves data to a database anyway, and miss the simplicity of having an entity save itself.

.. code-block:: php

    use Doctrine;

    /**
     * @Doctrine\Entity(storage="MSSql")
     * @Doctrine\ActiveRecord
     */
    class User
    {
        /** @Doctrine\Id */
        public $id;

        /** @Doctrine\Field(type="string") */
        public $login;
    }

    $user = new User();
    $user->load(10);
    $user->login = 'malarzm';
    $user->save();

Thanks to the ``@Doctrine\ActiveRecord`` annotation you're able to query for and save your entities easily. Please
notice that the `User` class does not extend any internal Doctrine class - you are still decoupled from the ORM!

We strongly believe that getting back to the Active Record pattern is the way to go for us. We weren't able to
fully get rid of the old fashioned Data Mapper pattern but you can expect its deprecation in one of first bug-fix releases
and full removal in a subsequent patch release (Active Record is replacing semantic versioning, too!)

Another big step towards the highly expected Developer eXperience was initially painful, as it required many
of us to come out of the Java bubble we live in, but we know it will be for the best. With the re-introduction of
Active Record the obvious next step is making all Doctrine utilities available in an easy and sane way: please welcome
static registries AND short method names!

.. code-block:: php

    use Doctrine;
    use Entity\MongoLog;
    use Entity\User;

    Doctrine::em()->start(); // start a transaction
    $user = new User(); // this is stored in MSSql
    $user = 'malarzm';
    $user->save(); // not saved yet
    $log = new MongoLog($user, 'was created'); // this will be "stored" in MongoDB
    $log->save(); // but not yet
    Doctrine::em()->commit(); // commit a transaction ACROSS multiple storage engines

Big shout out goes to `Marco <https://twitter.com/Ocramius>`__. Although he initially had a heart attack when first
hearing about this idea, he's come full circle after using the feature and is now a big proponent of static registries. Be sure
to watch for updates to all of his libraries in the near future!

Try It Out Now!
---------------

Uniting forces of all Doctrine developers has enabled us to ship an usable "alpha" version way sooner than originally
anticipated. But the truly thrilling news is that thanks to tremendous help from guys with `3v4l.org <https://3v4l.org/>`__
we have set up a sandbox environment so everybody can have a hands-on experience using the new version of Doctrine:

            We are happy to announce the immediate availability of Doctrine MongoDB
Abstraction Layer `1.4.0 <https://github.com/doctrine/mongodb/releases/tag/1.4.0>`__.

Passing context options to the driver
-------------------------------------

With this release it's possible to pass driver options to the connection class,
which will then be passed on to the MongoDB driver. For example, to pass a
stream context with SSL context options, you could use the following code
snippet:

.. code-block:: php

    $context = stream_context_create([
        'ssl' => [
            'allow_self_signed' => false,
        ]
    ]);
    $connection = new \Doctrine\MongoDB\Connection(null, [], null, null, ['context' => $context]);

Passing multiple expressions to logical operators
-------------------------------------------------

The ``addAnd``, ``addNor`` and ``addOr`` methods in the query and aggregation
builders now take multiple expression objects. Instead of having to call the
method repeatedly, you may call it once with multiple arguments:

.. code-block:: php

    // Before
    $builder
        ->addAnd($someExpression)
        ->addAnd($otherExpression);

    // After
    $builder->addAnd($someExpression, $otherExpression);

Deprecations
------------

The ``update`` and ``multiple`` methods in the query have been deprecated in
favor of ``updateOne`` and ``updateMany``. These deprecations help people using
ODM prepare for the next version of ODM which will utilize the new MongoDB
library API.

Bug fixes in this release
-------------------------

Notable fixes may be found in the
`changelog <https://github.com/doctrine/mongodb/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.4.md#140-2016-11-22>`__.
A full list of issues and pull requests included in this release may be found in the
`1.4.0 milestone <https://github.com/doctrine/mongodb/issues?q=milestone%3A1.4.0>`__.

PHP version support
-------------------

With this release, we have dropped support for PHP 5.5. Users using PHP 5.5 or
older are encouraged to upgrade to a newer PHP version. If you are using PHP 7.0
or 7.1, you can use this library by adding a polyfill for ``ext-mongo``, like
`mongo-php-adapter <https://github.com/alcaeus/mongo-php-adapter>`__.

Future releases
---------------

This release is the last planned minor release of the MongoDB Abstraction Layer,
with only bugfixes being done in maintenance releases. The library will not be
rewritten to support the new MongoDB driver. Users are encouraged to use the new
`MongoDB library <https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-php-library>`__. Doctrine
MongoDB ODM will be adapted to support the new driver and the MongoDB library.

Installation
------------

You can install the latest version using the following ``composer.json`` definitions:
