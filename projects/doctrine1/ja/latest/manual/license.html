    <li><strong>&quot;Adaptation&quot;</strong> means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work
and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
timed-relation with a moving image (&quot;synching&quot;) will be considered an
Adaptation for the purpose of this License.</li>

such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this
License.</li>

grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in
the Work as stated below:</p>

            
    
<ol type="a">

    <li>to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable
steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes
were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be
marked &quot;The original work was translated from English to Spanish,&quot; or
a modification could indicate &quot;The original work has been modified.&quot;;</li>

    <li>For the avoidance of doubt:
i.   <strong>Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes</strong>. In those
     jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through
     any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,
     the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such
     royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under
     this License;
ii.  <strong>Waivable Compulsory License Schemes</strong>. In those jurisdictions
     in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
     compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives

     by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
iii. <strong>Voluntary License Schemes</strong>. The Licensor waives the right to
     collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
     the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
     administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from
any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.</li>
</ol>

            
    <p>The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now

    <li value="4">Restrictions</li>
</ol>

            
    <p>The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and
limited by the following restrictions:</p>

            
    
<ol type="a">
    <li>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the
Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms
of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any
Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If
You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
required by Section 4(c), as requested.</li>
</ol>

            
    
<ol type="a">
    <li>You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with
the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons
jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that
contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,
Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible
License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses
mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If
you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses
mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the &quot;Applicable License&quot;), you must
comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the
following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for,
the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You
Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any
terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable
License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise
the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer
to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with
every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute
or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the
Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological measures
on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
Adaptation from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies
to the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
require the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made
subject to the terms of the Applicable License.</li>
</ol>

            
    
<ol type="a">
    <li>If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
entity, journal) for attribution (&quot;Attribution Parties&quot;) in
Licensor&#039;s copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work
if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b),
in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the
Work in the Adaptation (e.g., &quot;French translation of the Work by
Original Author,&quot; or &quot;Screenplay based on original Work by Original
Author&quot;). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented
in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a
credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as
prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the
avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
without the separate, express prior written permission of the
Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.</li>

<ol type="a">
    <li>Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
prejudicial to the Original Author&#039;s honor or reputation. Licensor
agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any
exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the
right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to
the Original Author&#039;s honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably
exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make
Adaptations) but not otherwise.</li>
