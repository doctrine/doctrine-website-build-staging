        </header>

        <p class="lead">
            Posted on 2010-12-21
                            by
                                    beberlei

        <div>
            <p>We are happy to announce the immediate release of the first stable
Doctrine 2.0 version. This release marks the end of 2.5 years of
dedicated development starting in early 2008 and ending as a
christmas present to our users. We wish everyone a merry
christmas!</p>
<p>During the last years a core team of five people contributed large
parts of the code and many developers contributed small patches and
features. In the end the Doctrine 1 code was refactored beyond
recognition, replacing the original ActiveRecord Doctrine 1 with a
new DataMapper implementation. We want to thank all the
contributors and early adopters for all the feedback and
discussions.</p>
<a id="title.1"></a><h1>What is new in Doctrine 2?</h1>
<ul><li class="dash"> DQL is now a real language inside Doctrine, based on an EBNF
   that is parsed and transformed to SQL. Benefits of this refactoring
   are readable error messages, the generation of an AST that allows
   us to support many different vendors and powerful hooks for
   developers to modify and extend the DQL language to their needs.
   DQL can either be written as a string or be generated using a
   powerful QueryBuilder object.</li>
<li class="dash"> Your persistent objects (called entities in Doctrine 2) are not
   required to extend an abstract base class anymore. Doctrine 2
   allows you to use Plain old PHP Objects.</li>
<li class="dash"> The UnitOfWork is not an alibi-pattern as implemented in
   Doctrine 1. It is the most central pattern in Doctrine 2. Instead
   of calling <code>save()</code> or <code>delete()</code> methods on your
   <code>Doctrine_Record</code> instances you now pass objects to the data
   mapper object called <code>EntityManager</code> and it keeps track of all
   changes until you request a synchronisation between database and
   the current objects in memory. This process is very efficient and
   has consistent semantics. This is a significant improvement over
   Doctrine 1 in terms of performance and developer ease-of-use.</li>
<li class="dash"> There are no code-generation steps from YAML to PHP involved in
   the library anymore. YAML, XML, PHP and Doc-Block Annotations are
   four first-class citizens for defining the metadata mapping between
   objects and database. A powerful caching layer allows Doctrine 2 to
   use runtime metadata without relying on code-generation.</li>
<li class="dash"> A clean architecture and powerful algorithms make Doctrine 2
   magnitudes faster than Doctrine 1.</li>
<li class="dash"> Doctrine 2 supports an API that allows you to transform an
   arbitrary SQL statements into an object-structure. This feature is
   used by the Doctrine Query Language itself and is a first-class
   citizen of the library. It essentially allows you to make use of
   powerful vendor-specific features and complex SQL statements
   without having to cirumvent the ORM completely.</li>
<li class="dash"> Inheritance is not akward anymore. There are now three different
   types of inheritance to choose from: Mapped Superclasses,
   Single-Table- and Joined-Table-Inheritance.</li>
<li class="dash"> Many more features, just see the reference guide on what is
   possible with Doctrine 2.</li>
</ul>

<a id="title.2"></a><h1>Why did we take so long to develop this new major release?</h1>
<p>There are several reasons:</p>
<p>The refactoring of the original Doctrine 1 code marks a paradigm
shift in how we approach object persistence in PHP. Making use of
PHP 5.3 only features we could write an ORM whose internals are
much more powerful than the first version of Doctrine. This meant
rewriting lots of features from scratch and refactoring other code
beyond recognition. Many features were carefully implemented and
have been discussed for weeks or month in our team. We feel that
not a single feature in this release can be called a hack or has
negative architectural implications along the road.</p>
<p>As a user an ORM means committing yourself to a library that you
haven't written yourself and trust it to handle your most important
code: The business and domain logic. We wanted to release a high
quality library and make sure it has no bugs when it is released.
This explains why the first alpha was already released over a year
ago and we have been fixing every little bug that appeared for the
last 14 months. When you download Doctrine 2 now we feel this code
is more stable and much more maintainable than Doctrine 1. The ORM
itself has about 1000 tests where half of these are functional
tests that successfully run against all the supported database
vendors MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Oracle and MSSQL. The database
access layer and common libraries come with an additional 400
tests.</p>
<p>We wanted the release to ship with a complete and well-thought-out
documentation. Writing such a documentation takes time. The current
documentation is probably not perfect, but it contains a very
detailed reference guide and a small tutorial to get started.
Additionally there is a cookbook with several recipes that you can
use with your Doctrine 2 project.</p>
<p>While Doctrine 1 had pretty powerful SQL abstraction we felt there
were better libraries out there that could be incoporated into
Doctrine 2. The new database abstraction layer of Doctrine 2 is
much more powerful than the Doctrine 1 DBAL and is powered by code
from other great libraries such as Zeta Components, Zend Framework
and PEAR MDB2. On top of this it can also be used standalone, you
can use the DBAL without having to use the ORM.</p>
<a id="title.3"></a><h1>Dropping Features of Doctrine 1</h1>
<p>But Doctrine 2 is not only a new version of Doctrine 1. We also
dropped a lot of features that we find inappropriate for the core
of an ORM library:</p>
<ul><li class="dash"> Validators have been dropped. Use a framework library like Zend
   or Symfony for validator support, they ship much more powerful
   validators than Doctrine 1 ever had. If you don't like frameworks
   there is ext/filter to consider.</li>
<li class="dash"> We killed the magic features: Doctrine 2 does not offer
   behaviors as a core feature anymore. We came to the conclusion that
   behaviors in the core lead to the big ball of mud called Doctrine</li>
<ol><li>The code is nearly unmaintainable because of all the special
   logic and magic that works everywhere. That is why Doctrine 2
   focuses on being a consistent and extensible object-relational
   mapper only and behaviors should be released as extensions on top
   of Doctrine 2. While this approach was questioned by many of the
   Doctrine 1 users we think this is the right approach. We are
   already seeing third party libraries and extensions like Doctrator
   based on Doctrine 2 that implement these features.</li>
</ol>
<li class="dash"> Explicit multiple connection support has been dropped. Use
   multiple instances of <code>Doctrine\DBAL\Connection</code> or
   <code>Doctrine\ORM\EntityManager</code>. Doctrine 2 uses no global state
   that could affect the usage of multiple instances.</li>
</ul>

<a id="title.4"></a><h1>Is Doctrine 2 backwards compatible?</h1>
<p>No it is not. Doctrine 1 and 2 have nothing in common. For what its
worth they only share the same project name. You cannot simply move
from your Doctrine 1.2 to a Doctrine 2 project. Why didn't we
release a backwards compatible ORM? Because we think Doctrine 1 has
architectural flaws that cannot be fixed.</p>
<a id="title.5"></a><h1>What is the plan for Doctrine 2 beyond this release?</h1>
<p>With the core that is now Doctrine 2 we plan to keep the library
backwards compatible at all times. Not only for minor and
mini-releases such as 2.0.1 or 2.1, even for potential releases of
a Doctrine 3 or 4 version we plan to avoid public API refactorings
as much as possible. If however we feel that there is overwhelming
evidence that a public API refactoring makes the ORM faster and
leads to more maintainable code we will not hesitate to break API
for a 3.0 release.</p>
<p>This approach comes at costs that we are willing to pay. All new
features have to pass a requirements discussion and pros/cons are
carefully weighted against each other. That is also why we try to
expose as little of our internals as possible. This certainly hurts
extensibility of Doctrine 2, but with our expected quality level
and review process we hope to bring the costs of this approach
down. You should never be forced to extend Doctrine 2 just to fix
bugs, which is the most important reason for extensibility in other
PHP libraries.</p>
<a id="title.6"></a><h1>Where do I start?</h1>
<p>You can download Doctrine 2
<a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/orm/download">from our downloads section</a> ,
<a href="http://pear.doctrine-project.org/">install it via PEAR</a> or find
it in the
<a href="http://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2">Github repository</a>.
Symfony 2 also ships with a current version of Doctrine 2. After
you installed Doctrine 2 you can
<a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/orm/2.0/en/">go to the documentation</a>
and start reading the reference guide or
<a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/orm/2.0/en/tutorials/getting-started-xml-edition.html">the tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>If you find any bugs or have feature requests you should check our
<a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/jira">Bug-Tracker and report bugs or feature requests</a>.
If you want to discuss about Doctrine 2 you can either
<a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/community">use the Google Group or join the #doctrine channel on the Freenode IRC Network</a>.
Also make sure to check the current
<a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/docs/orm/2.0/en/reference/limitations-and-known-issues.html">Limitations and Known Issues section</a>
in the docs. We are trying to be honest about what Doctrine 2 can
and can't do but might do in the future.</p>
